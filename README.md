Rainy Days is a userfriendly e-commerce website offering rain jackets for men and women aged 30-50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing. 
The website is built with HTML and CSS. JavaScript was later integrated for enhanced interactivity. To streamline updates, I implemented a WordPress headless CMS (API) for dynamic product fetching. This ensures a seamless and up-to-date online shopping experience.
